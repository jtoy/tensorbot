## a tensorflow and raspberry pi powered autonomous robot


## Tensorbot, or T-Bot for short

T-Bot aims to be the worlds smallest artificial intelligence robot. We want to make T-Bot accessible to everyone by making it affordable and easy to learn about artificial intelligence.

Currently T-Bot drives around autonomously and observes its environment via its camera. When it sees something it recognizes, it will talk through its speaker and tell us what it sees. T-Bot uses Tensorflow, Google’s open source deep learning engine trained on ImageNet along with other datasets. ImageNet consists of 15 million images of various categories.

We plan to further develop T-Bot. We envision better speech synthesization and additional features such as facial recognition, motion detection and increased mobility. We may consider making T-Bot easy to integrate into any robotic device, such that it can be used as a component for a drone or similar.
